It assigns distinct values to different results of the experiment, making it variable. As each outcome holds an element of uncertainty, the variable is considered random.\n\nIn probability, a common representation for a random variable is using a capital letter (e.g., X), and a specific value is denoted by a corresponding lowercase letter (e.g., x). For instance, when flipping a coin twice, the potential outcomes form the sample space:\n\nS = {HH, HT, TH, TT}\n\nFrom this sample space, the random variable X can be defined as:\n\nX = {HH, HT, TH, TT}\n\nRandom variables are categorized into two types: continuous and discrete random variables.\n\n**Discrete random variables** are limited to specific, whole-number values and do not include fractions or decimals. They generate discrete probability distributions.\n\n**Examples** include the total outcome of rolling two dice (ranging from 2 to 12) or the count of desktops sold (starting from 0 and increasing by whole numbers).\n\nIn application, discrete random variables describe distinct quantities, such as the number of aircraft taking off and landing at an airport at a given time or the specific count of communication lines activated in an organization's system.\n\nOn the other hand, **continuous random variables** encompass a broad range of values, including decimals and fractions. They give rise to continuous probability distributions.\n\n**Examples** of continuous random variables involve quantities like interest rates (such as 4.55% or 7.9%) or durations like task completion times.\n\nIn practical scenarios, continuous random variables are employed to represent measurements like reaction temperature errors or the probability of a construction project completing within a specific timeframe, such as between 20 and 24 months with a probability of 0.5.\n\n## Probability\n\nProbability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as percentages or descriptive terms like \"impossible\" or \"probable.\" It encompasses the chances of various outcomes, such as rolling a specific number on a die. For instance, the probability of rolling a \"4\" on a six-sided die is 1 out of 6, considering there's only one favorable outcome among six possibilities.\n\n## Why Probability?\n\nIn the realm of machine learning, uncertainty and stochastic elements often emerge due to incomplete observability, leading us to work primarily with sampled data.\n\nConsider a scenario where we aim to make reliable inferences about the behavior of a random variable, despite having access only to limited data, leaving the entire population characteristics unknown.\n\n![Estimating the data-generating process (src: <https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-variables-and-probability-distributions-1ed1daf2e66>)](1%20e2LIgXPudagHYON8HdRO_g.webp)\n\nTherefore, we require a method to extrapolate from the sampled data to represent the entire population or, in simpler terms, estimate the true process generating the data. Understanding the probability distribution becomes crucial as it allows us to gauge the likelihood of specific outcomes while accommodating the variability observed in the results. This comprehension enables us to extend conclusions from the sample to the broader population, approximate the function generating the data, and enhance the accuracy of predicting the behavior of a random variable.\n\n### Discrete Probability Distribution\n\nDiscrete probability distributions stem from discrete data and aim to model predictions or outcomes, such as pricing options or forecasting market shocks. These distributions illustrate the possible values of a discrete random variable along with their corresponding probabilities. Examples include the Bernoulli, geometric, and binomial distributions. Here are some common examples of discrete probability distributions:\n\n1.  **Bernoulli Distribution:** Models a single trial with two outcomes, often used in success/failure experiments.\n\n2.  **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with a constant probability of success.\n\n3.  **Poisson Distribution:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.\n\n### Continuous Probability Distribution\n\nIn contrast, continuous probability distributions cover an infinite range of values, making them uncountable, like time extending from 0 seconds indefinitely. Examples involve continuous measurements like annual rainfall in a city or the weight of newborn babies, where the range of values is limitless and not countable in a finite manner. Here are some common examples of continuous probability distributions:\n\n1.  **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:** Symmetric bell-shaped curve that describes many natural phenomena like heights or test scores.\n\n2.  **Uniform Distribution:** All values in an interval have equal probability, forming a rectangle in the probability density function.\n\n3.  **Exponential Distribution:** Models the time between events in a Poisson process, such as the time between phone calls at a call center.\n\n#### Example of discrete probability distribution\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the Titanic dataset\ntitanic_data = sns.load_dataset('titanic')\n\n# Filter data for relevant columns (class and survival)\nsurvival_data = titanic_data[['pclass', 'survived']]\n\n# Calculate survival probabilities based on passenger class\nsurvival_probabilities = survival_data.groupby('pclass')['survived'].mean()\n\n# Plotting the probability distribution\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsurvival_probabilities.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')\nplt.title('Survival Probability by Passenger Class')\nplt.xlabel('Passenger Class')\nplt.ylabel('Survival Probability')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.ylim(0, 1)  #
